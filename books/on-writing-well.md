## Simplicity

Fight the temptation to inflate with words. We are aiming to sound important but we are only adding clutter and weakening the point.

Remove words, phrases and sentences that serve no function.

Examples of bloat:

- adverbs with the same meaning as the verb
- long words
- passive statements

Clutter puts too much work on the reader. They will get lost, distracted or bored. Cluttered writing shows lack of respect their attention.

To help keep the point of the writing clear the writer should:

- Ask: *what am I trying to say?*
- Look at what has been written and ask: *have I said it?*
- Then ask: *did I say it clearly?*

If the answer to any of these questions is fuzzy, rework is necessary. Clarity and simplicity must be distilled, clutter removed.

Clutter creeps in when the purpose is vague. Thinking clearly requires intention and focus.

## Clutter

### Be Concise

Good, bad, worse.

**Now** - Short word, clear, natural

**Currently** - Long word, sounds inflated, unnatural in speech

**At this present time** - Phrase, inhuman, sounds like a corporate statement

### Sound Human

*Does it hurt?* - human

*Are you experiencing feelings of pain?* - robot

Clutter makes statements sound non-commital, vague, weak, distant.

> Clutter is the official language used by corporations to hide their mistakes.

## Style

> The fundamental rule is to be yourself.

Clutter is not style. The writer should not worry about losing style when cleaning up clutter. In truth, freedom from clutter will create room for style to develop.

Ditch non-commital statments.

> I've also noticed a new reason for avoiding "I": Americans are unwilling to go out on a limb.

Don't be afraid to be revealed to the audience. A real person should be doing the writing. It always sounds unnatural to separate expressions from the "I" doing the expressing.

> We have become a society fearful of revealing who we are.

## Audience

> You are writing for yourself. Readers don't know what they want until they read it.

## Unity

Choose your variables and be consistent with the choice:

- Pronoun
- Tense
- Tone

## The Lead

TODO:

## The Ending

TODO:

## Business Writing

It's not a crime to be yourself in business writing. When you opt for jargon, you are throwing away a valuable resource: yourself.

> Any organization that won't take the trouble to be both clear and personal will lose friends, customers and money.

American business culture has embraced a lie: simple words expose a simple mind. Clear, simple communication will not return. Not when ego is at stake. Peer pressure pushes the falsehood forward - jargon is parroted. But the truth is: simplicity is the result of deep thought and hard work.

> ..[employees] don't risk their job to make the company human..

### Jargon

Jargon serves the organization, it's politics, policies, procedures. No customer is asking for it. It should never leak out to the customer, though it often does in copy, statements and customer service scripts.

Where is the value in using internal jargin only to have to convert it to sensible words for the customer? Why not use sensible words throughout. Employees would feel connected to a relatable vision. They would follow processes built for humans. They could spend their time solving rather than politicking.
