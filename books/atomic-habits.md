4 steps involved in a habit

- Cue
- Craving
- Response
- Reward

## Habit Ranking

Log actions in an existing routine and give them a rank of positive, negative or neutral.

Waking up:

- check phone - negative
- use bathroom - neutral
- brush teeth - positive
- shower - positive
- make bed - positive

Look over the negative and think about how to easily eliminate.

i.e. Move phone charger to kitchen, or bathroom.

## Habit Stacking

Insert a newly desired habit into existing habits.

> After I get home from work I will change into exercise clothes.

> After starting the coffee maker I will meditate for 5 minutes

The timing should be as specific as possible. *Doing 10 pushups after closing my laptop for lunch* is better than *Do 10 pushups during lunch break*.

## Adding Good Habits

- Make them attractive

Do the opposite with habits you wish to break.

Take the batteries out of the TV remote. Move junkfood to the fridge in the garage.
