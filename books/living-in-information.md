# Key Takeaways

## Attention Footprint

Just as individuals, organizations and governments ought to be responsible with resources (especially non-renewable resources) for the well being of our natural environments, designers and application builders should be conscious of creating a larger than necessary attention footprint. Human attention is a non-renewable resource, maybe it's the ultimate non-renewable resource.

## Engagement

Environments that optimize for engagement may be contrary to the purposes of the users. Contrast the third place model in Starbucks and Facebook. Starbucks exchanges money for use of the environment which facilitates social interactions well. Facebook exchanges users' attention to advertisers, which is in contradiction to the goal of social exchange between people. Facebook manipulates the feed (interactions) to create a more engaging (addictive) experience so they have more of their commodity (attention) to sell. They delude the function of the third place because their monetization model is naturally opposed to that core function.
