# Key Takeaways

## Attention Footprint

Just as individuals, organizations and governments ought to be responsible with resources (especially non-renewable resources) for the well being of our natural environments, designers and application builders should be conscious of creating a larger than necessary attention footprint. Human attention is a non-renewable resource, maybe it's the ultimate non-renewable resource.

## Engagement

Environments that optimize for engagement may be contrary to the purposes of the users. Contrast the third place model in Starbucks and Facebook. Starbucks exchanges money for use of the environment which facilitates social interactions well. Facebook exchanges users' attention to advertisers, which is in contradiction to the goal of social exchange between people. Facebook manipulates the feed (interactions) to create a more engaging (addictive) experience so they have more of their commodity (attention) to sell. They delude the function of the third place because their monetization model is naturally opposed to that core function.

## The Building Blocks of a System

- Objective or Goal
- Resources
- Feedback
- Boundary

## Environment Design Considerations

- Function
- Ergonomics
- Understandability
- Quality
- Coherence
- Fit
- Resilience

## Mapping Conceptual Moddels

What is the domain of human activity? (Healthcare, Finance.. ect.)

Who will be using it?

How much do the users understand about the domain before engaging it?

What are their expectations? What do they expect to find?

What do they call things?

Where are the natural divisions for parts of the environment?

Do system components need to be their own systems?

Are there any unexpected relationships between elements, how will the environment accommodate them?

What business goals does the environment serve?

Are business and user goals in alignment?

Are the user and business time perspectives aligned?

Where are the boundaries of the environment?

## Gall's Law

> A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked. A complex system designed from scratch never works and cannot be patched up to make it work. You have to start over with a simple working system.

## Static Systems

Static systems slide towards irrelevance over time.

## Skin in the Game

Traditionally architects/builders have had skin in the game for their creations. Someone injurred in a building has recourse against the builders or maintainers of the building. This incentivises reslience.

Factors required for resilience:

- Attitude necessary for change
- Awareness
- Empowered to change
- Vision for the purpose, and understanding how it is used
- The original design must accomodate change for (graceful) change to be possible

## Sustainability

A sustainable environment has the conditions necessary for the system to meet the needs of its present stakeholders without compromising the needs of its future stakeholders.

### Economic Stability

It must generate resources to support itself. Servers, labor to design and execute changes. Some envrionments provide valuable social impact but lack the financial component that allows continued existence.

### Purpose Sustainability

It must not compromise its own purpose to accommodate the financial model. Think advertising in the third place. If the method of monetization is in opposition to the purpose the users have in mind, the environmnet will not have longevity.

## Generative Environments

Prescribed structures result in a re-design effort out of the norm. Requiements must be right. Prototypes help to mitigate the missed requirement risk, but still cannot be adequately battle tested under real conditions with real users, with the full interaction.

Not all environments need to be or are generative. But a system may need to emerge as generative.. More importantly the architects, builders, maintainers, stewards of the system should not plan or design for "Constant". People should understands systems and change.

## Misc & Conclusions

Context births forms and forms influence context in a constant cycle.

Frames are powerful structures that shape how we see the world. Frames support various versions of the world. They affect how we interprate outcomes, good and bad? "How we talk about things" is a frame, and that frame influences "How we do things", our culture.

Technical excellence should come second to ethical (responsibility) excellence. Is ethics too extreme a word to describe "an app we use"? Well, we can create an algo designed to up a persons attention, which is at odds with their goal in using the app (extending their personal, or social potential). That is deceitfully consuming a precious non-renewable resource of that person, yes I would put that in the category of ethics!

The purpose of information is to help us make decisions that further our best interests as individuals, organizations, societies.. We should design our information environments to respect and value our attention. This is opposed to the approach of "engagement for engagement's sake".

Creating a successful environment that is responsible, viable, generative, purposeful, empowering requires architecture to build and stewardship to evolve and maintain. The architects and stewards will require leadership, vision, and courage to think deeply, broadly, and long term.
